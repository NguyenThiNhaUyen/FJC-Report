### [Event 1](4.1-Event1/)  
&emsp;**Event Name:** GenAI and Data (Gen AI and Data Track – AWS Summit)  
&emsp;**Date & Time:** 09:00 – 17:30, September 18, 2025  
&emsp;**Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Saigon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City  
&emsp;**Role:** Attendee  

&emsp;**Short Description:**  
The event was a full-day track focusing on Generative AI and data strategy on AWS. The sessions covered building a unified data platform for AI and analytics (data ingestion from multiple sources, cost-optimized storage, processing with AWS Glue, EMR, and Redshift, and data governance), AWS’s GenAI adoption roadmap with Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Q, the AI-driven software development lifecycle (AI-DLC), comprehensive security practices for GenAI applications, and the growing role of AI Agents in improving organizational productivity.

&emsp;**Outcomes / Value Gained:**  
&emsp;• Strengthened understanding of GenAI adoption strategies on AWS, emphasizing small experiments and gradual scaling aligned with business objectives.  
&emsp;• Gained a clear view of the core components of a unified data platform and the importance of governance and access control alongside storage and processing.  
&emsp;• Acquired practical ideas for applying AI-DLC to improve development productivity, such as documentation support, test case generation, and code improvement suggestions.  
&emsp;• Increased awareness of multi-layer GenAI security, including infrastructure, model access control, and application-layer protection.

### [Event 2](4.2-Event2/)  
&emsp;**Event Name:** GenAI-powered App-DB Modernization Workshop  
&emsp;**Date & Time:** 09:00, August 13, 2025  
&emsp;**Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Saigon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City  
&emsp;**Role:** Attendee  

&emsp;**Short Description:**  
The event was an in-depth workshop on application and database modernization, focusing on the transition from legacy architectures to modern approaches such as microservices and event-driven architecture. Key topics included Domain-Driven Design (DDD) techniques such as event storming, bounded contexts, and context mapping; comparisons of integration patterns (pub/sub, point-to-point, and streaming); and an analysis of how compute models evolve from EC2 to containers and serverless. The workshop also highlighted the use of AI tools, particularly Amazon Q Developer and transformation agents, to support and accelerate modernization efforts.

&emsp;**Outcomes / Value Gained:**  
&emsp;• Developed a business-first mindset for system modernization and improved the ability to build a shared ubiquitous language among stakeholders.  
&emsp;• Learned how to define clear service boundaries using bounded contexts and apply event-driven communication to reduce coupling between system components.  
&emsp;• Gained a better understanding of the criteria for choosing between virtual machines, containers, and serverless options (functions and container-based).  
&emsp;• Identified practical application paths such as organizing event storming sessions, refactoring services based on bounded contexts, experimenting with asynchronous messaging, and using Amazon Q Developer to enhance development productivity.
