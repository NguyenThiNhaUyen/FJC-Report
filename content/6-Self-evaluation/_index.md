During my internship at **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** from **September 08** to **December 24**, I had the opportunity to experience a professional working environment and apply academic knowledge to real-world tasks. This period allowed me to gain practical experience while improving both technical and soft skills.

I participated in the **Metro project**, where I worked on assigned tasks related to programming, requirement analysis, technical documentation, and reporting. Through these activities, I gradually improved my ability to work independently, understand project requirements, and adapt to the team’s workflow.

Regarding work attitude, I consistently aimed to complete tasks on time, comply with company regulations, and actively communicate with mentors and teammates whenever challenges arose. I believe these efforts helped me contribute positively to the project.

Based on my overall internship experience, I present my self-evaluation as follows:
