###  [Blog 1 - Generative AI-powered game design: Accelerating early development with Stability AI models on Amazon Bedrock](3.1-Blog1/)
This blog explores how Stability AI's Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large model on Amazon Bedrock revolutionizes game development workflows. You will learn how generative AI accelerates early-stage concept art creation, character design, and environment generation. The article demonstrates practical use cases including prompt engineering for fantasy landscapes, game assets, and props, while showcasing SD3.5 Large's enhanced photorealism, superior scene complexity, and improved anatomical rendering capabilities. Step-by-step guidance covers setting up Amazon SageMaker, accessing models through Amazon Bedrock, and iterating on generated concepts to create high-fidelity visual references for 3D artists.

###  [Blog 2 - Harness Amazon Q Business power with Microsoft SharePoint for enterprise search](3.2-Blog2/)
This blog demonstrates how to integrate Amazon Q Business with Microsoft SharePoint Server to unlock enterprise knowledge using generative AI. You will learn how to configure secure data connectors that honor existing user permissions through ACLs and AWS IAM Identity Center synchronization. The article guides you through setting up SharePoint Server on Amazon EC2, configuring AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory, and implementing natural language queries with principle of least privilege enforcement. Real-world scenarios illustrate how different user roles access filtered results based on their SharePoint permissions, ensuring data confidentiality while improving productivity and decision-making across the organization.

###  [Blog 3 - Ground truth generation and review best practices for evaluating generative AI question-answering with FMEval](3.3-Blog3/)
This blog provides comprehensive best practices for generating and evaluating ground truth datasets to assess generative AI question-answering systems using Amazon SageMaker Clarify's FMEval. You will learn how to scale ground truth creation through LLM-powered automation using Amazon Bedrock, implement serverless batch pipelines with AWS Step Functions and Lambda, and establish risk-based human-in-the-loop (HITL) review processes. The article covers question-answer-fact triplet curation, prompt engineering techniques for Claude on Bedrock, hallucination detection strategies, and LLM-as-a-judge patterns to ensure deterministic evaluation of RAG applications while maintaining high-quality benchmarks for enterprise knowledge assistants.
