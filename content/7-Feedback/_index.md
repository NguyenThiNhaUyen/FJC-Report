### General Feedback

**1. Working Environment**  
During my internship, I found the working environment to be friendly and open. Members of the FCJ program were always willing to support and discuss work-related issues when I faced difficulties. The workspace was organized and comfortable, which helped me stay focused. However, having more informal activities or team bonding sessions could further strengthen connections among team members.

**2. Support from Mentor and Program Team**  
My mentor provided clear guidance and patiently explained topics whenever I had questions. The admin team supported interns well in terms of documentation, schedules, and procedures. I especially appreciated the mentor’s approach of encouraging me to explore solutions independently before giving direct answers, which helped me learn more effectively.

**3. Relevance Between Internship Tasks and Major**  
The tasks assigned during the internship were aligned with my Software Engineering background while also introducing new areas that I had not experienced before. This balance allowed me to reinforce my foundational knowledge and gain practical exposure to real-world systems and workflows.

**4. Learning Opportunities and Skill Development**  
Throughout the internship, I developed various skills such as using project management tools, collaborating within a team, and communicating in a professional environment. Additionally, the mentor’s real-world insights helped me better understand potential career paths and workplace expectations.

**5. Company Culture and Team Spirit**  
The company culture was positive and supportive. Team members treated each other with respect and maintained a professional yet comfortable working atmosphere. During high-pressure tasks, everyone worked together to meet deadlines, which made me feel included as part of the team despite being an intern.

**6. Internship Policies and Benefits**  
The internship program provided financial support and allowed flexibility when necessary. Interns also had opportunities to attend internal training sessions, which significantly enhanced the overall learning experience.

From my perspective, the program could be improved by:
  1. Providing a clearer onboarding plan with weekly milestones and expected outcomes.

### Suggestions and Expectations

- **Suggestions for improving the internship experience**  
  - Developing a centralized intern handbook or knowledge base (e.g., Notion) containing guidelines, FAQs, and reporting templates.  
  - Holding short weekly sync meetings between interns and mentors/admins to quickly address obstacles.  
  - Organizing mini demo or presentation sessions at the end of each phase to receive early feedback.

- **Future Participation**  
If given the opportunity, I would be interested in continuing with the program in a more advanced intern role or supporting future interns, as the experience has been highly beneficial for my personal and professional growth.

- **Additional Comments**  
I sincerely appreciate the support from the FCJ team, mentors, and program administrators throughout my internship. I hope the program continues to improve and provides even better opportunities for future interns.
